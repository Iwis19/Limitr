# Limitr 🛡️

API protection and abuse-detection platform with a Spring Boot backend and Angular admin dashboard for monitoring, rule tuning, and enforcement workflows.

---

## Repository Note

Most of the development began locally since the summer, but more implementations in the future will be committed as soon as i finish each feature!

## Key Features

1. **API Key Protection + Rate Limiting**
   - `ApiProtectionFilter` guards `/api/**` routes with `X-API-KEY` authentication
   - Per-principal fixed-window rate limiting with response headers (`X-RateLimit-*`, `Retry-After`)
   - Supports dynamic limits based on enforcement state
2. **Abuse Detection Layer**
   - Scores principals from behavior signals (rate-limit abuse, failed auth, request spikes, resource enumeration)
   - Uses rolling time windows and cooldown logic to reduce noise
   - Feeds directly into enforcement decisions
3. **Enforcement + Incident Handling**
   - Automatic state progression (`OK` → `WARN` → `THROTTLED` → `TEMP_BANNED`)
   - Temporary bans with expiration + manual ban/unban actions
   - Incident logging + avoid repeated spam records
4. **Admin Dashboard Interface**
   - Angular SPA 
   - Live admin actions for filtering 
   - Rule editing UI for thresholds
5. **Auth + Persistence**
   - JWT-based admin authentication 
   - Spring Data JPA persistence 
   - PostgreSQL primary datastore with H2 profile support

---

## Tech Stack
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot** (Web, Security, Validation, JPA)
- **PostgreSQL** + **H2**
- **Angular 18** + **TypeScript**
- **JWT** (`jjwt`)
- Maven, RxJS

## Lessons Learned
- Designing layered API defenses that combine limits, scoring, and enforcement
- Balancing protection with operator visibility through logs and incidents
- Full-stack workflow with aligned control and logics
- Managing JWT auth flow on Angular 
- Iterating on threshold tuning without breaking
